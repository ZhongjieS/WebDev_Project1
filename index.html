    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi everyone! I’m Jack. I am currently in my third year of the <strong>Information Technology and Management (ITM)</strong> program. 
      My academic journey is driven by my facination with the "insvisible" side of internet where security are often not taken seriously by daily consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ultimate goal is to move into the <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> field, with a long-term plan to earn a Master’s in <strong>Cyber Forensics</strong>. 
      I enjoy the challenge of finding flaws in internet engineering and developing innovative ways to improve system integrity.
