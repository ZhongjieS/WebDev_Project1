    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi everyone! I’m Jack. I am currently in my third year of the <strong>Information Technology and Management (ITM)</strong> program. 
      My academic journey is driven by my facination with the "insvisible" side of internet where security are often not taken seriously by daily consumers.

      My ultimate goal is to move into the <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> field, with a long-term plan to earn a Master’s in <strong>Cyber Forensics</strong>. 
      I enjoy the challenge of finding flaws in internet engineering and developing innovative ways to improve system integrity.
