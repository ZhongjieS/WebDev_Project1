      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi everyone! I’m Jack. I am currently in my third year of the <strong>Information Technology and Management (ITM)</strong> program. 
        My academic journey is driven by my fascination with the "invisible" side of internet where security are often not taken seriously by daily consumers.
        I believe that security is frequently an afterthought in modern development, and I want 
        to be part of the change that shifts security into more businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        My ultimate goal is to move into the <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> field, with a long-term plan to earn a Master’s in <strong>Cyber Forensics</strong>. 
        I enjoy the challenge of finding flaws in internet engineering and developing innovative ways to improve system integrity.

      <p>
        Aside from academic studies, a big part of my time are dedicated to <strong>Bodybuilding</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I also spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I enjoy finding recipes that benefits my hard works in the gym 
        and support my nutritional goals. For me, it is all about consistency.

      <h2>Outside the Classroom</h2>
      <p>
        When I am not studying or at the gym, I spending my free time on my personal interests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Guitar and Music:</strong> Although I'm only a beginner, debugging code or hitting a specific lift in the gym is just like
          playing guitar. It is a skill that requires muscle memory and consistency. I enjoy the process of breaking down 
          songs into manageable parts and practicing them until I am fluid with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Competitive Gaming:</strong> I enjoy fast-paced, competitive games that require quick thinking and strategy. I like the high skill 
          ceiling and the strategic depth these game require. The need for quick thinking and rapid decision-making under pressure gets my adrenaline going and ironically makes me less stress from the real world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dog Training:</strong> I am a massive dog lover and spend a lot of time training my dog, Coffee. I find that 
          the process of teaching new skills to a pet requires a level of patience and clear, non-verbal communication 
          that I find incredibly rewarding. It is a great way to step away from the digital world and connect with nature.
          <p>Here is a photo of my dog, Coffee.</p>
